                        History
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. 
                        It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (1628 - 1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; 
                        it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 
                        The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                    </p>   
                    <h1>
                        Symbolism
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Along with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan's wealth and power, and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule.
                        Bilateral symmetry dominated by a central axis has been used by rulers as a symbol of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan applied that concept in the making of the Taj Mahal.
                        Additionally, the plan is aligned in the cardinal north - south direction and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the centre of the plan, the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively. 
                        This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.<br>
                        The planning and structure of the Taj Mahal, from the building itself to the gardens and beyond, is symbolic of Mumtaz Mahal's mansion in the garden of Paradise.
                        The concept of Gardens of Paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well. 
                        Colorful vines and flowers decorate the interior, and are filled in with semi-precious stones using a technique called pietra dura, or as the Mughals called it, parchin kari. 
                        The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. 
                        The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself. 
                        This is another way to imply the presence of Allah at the site.<br>
                        The Taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form, and is thought to embody Mumtaz Mahal herself.

                    <h1>
                        Architecture and design
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. 
                        Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. 
                        While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. 
                        Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Tomb</b><br>
                        The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. 
                        It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. 
                        Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.
                        The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides.
                        Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. 
                        The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; 
                        the actual graves are at a lower level.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        <b>Exterior decorations</b><br>
                        The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. 
                        As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. 
                        The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. 
                        In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. 
                        Throughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. 
                        Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.<br>
                        On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        <b>Interior decorations</b><br>
                        The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. 
                        The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.
                        The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. 
                        The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a "false" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. 
                        Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall. 
                        The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or jali a grill lattice cut from marble. 
                        In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. 
                        The octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. 
                        The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. 
                        Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect.

                                                    While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. 
                                                    Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.

                                                    <b>Tomb</b><br>
                                                    The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. 
                                                    It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. 
                                                    Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.
                                                    The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides.
                                                    Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. 
                                                    The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; 
                                                    the actual graves are at a lower level.

                                                <p>
                                                    <b>Exterior decorations</b><br>
                                                    The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. 
                                                    As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. 
                                                    The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. 
                                                    In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. 
                                                    Throughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. 
                                                    Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.<br>
                                                    On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. 
                                                </p> 
                                                <p>
                                                    <b>Interior decorations</b><br>
                                                    The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. 
                                                    The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.
                                                    The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. 
                                                    The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a "false" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. 
                                                    Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall. 
                                                    The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or jali a grill lattice cut from marble. 
                                                    In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. 
                                                    The octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. 
                                                    The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. 
                                                    Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect.
