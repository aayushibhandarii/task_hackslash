                        This group of sanctuaries, founded by the Pallava kings, was carved out of rock along the Coromandel coast in the 7th and 8th centuries. 
                        It is known especially for its rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), giant open-air reliefs such as the famous 'Descent of the Ganges', and the temple of Rivage, with thousands of sculptures to the glory of Shiva.

                        History
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Although the ancient history of Mahabalipuram is unclear, numismatic and epigraphical evidence and its temples suggest that it was a significant location before the monuments were built. 
                        It is speculated that it is the seaport of Sopatma mentioned in the 1st-century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea or Ptolemy's port of Melange in his 2nd-century Geographia. 
                        Another theory posits that the port of Nirppeyarvu mentioned in the Perumpanarrupadai from the late 19th century to early 20th century may be Mahabalipuram or Kanchipuram.<br>
                        In his Avantisundari Katha, the 7th - 8th century Sanskrit scholar Daṇḍin (who lived in Tamil Nadu and was associated with the Pallava court) praised artists for their repair of a Vishnu sculpture at Mamallapuram.
                        However, Daṇḍin's authorship of this text is disputed.
                        The medieval Sanskrit text mentions the Mamallapuram monuments, an early tradition of repairs, and the significance of Vaishnavism.

                        About
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The monuments are a fusion of religion, culture and legend relating to the Hindu religious pantheon. 
                        They are expressions through rock or inside boulders, on a grand scale, integrating nature and sculpture. 
                        The site has about forty monuments, in varying degrees of completion, categorized into five groups:
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Rathas: chariot-shaped temples</p></li>
                            <li><p>Mandapas: Cave temples</p></li>
                            <li><p>Rock reliefs</p></li>
                            <li><p>Structural temples</p></li>
                            <li><p>Excavations</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            There are ten major rathas, ten mandapas, two rock bas-reliefs and three structural temples.
                            The monumental plan is based on a square and circle, or stacked squares (producing a rectangle). 
                            The reliefs, sculptures and architecture incorporate Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism, with each monument dedicated to a deity or a character in Hindu mythology.
                            The monuments are a source of many 7th- and 8th-century Sanskrit inscriptions, providing insight into medieval South Indian history, culture, government and religion.
                        </p>
                        
                    </p>          
                    <p>
                        <b>Ratha temples</b><br>
                        The ratha temples, in southern Mahabalipuram, are carved in the shape of chariots. 
                        Their artists used naturally-occurring blocks of diorite and granite in sand, carving legends in stone.
                        The best-known are the five monolithic structures projecting above the beach, known as the Five Rathas or the Pandava Rathas. 
                        In the Mahabharata, the Pandavas are five brothers with a common wife, Draupadi. 
                        Although the symbolism and grouping of the temples have led to these popular names, they are neither true rathas nor dedicated to the Pandavas; 
                        they are temples dedicated to deities and concepts of the Shaivi, (Shiva), Vaishnavi (Vishnu) and Shakti (Durga) traditions of Hinduism.<br>
                        The five-ratha group is on a north - south axis with the Dharmaraja Ratha at the south end, followed by the Bhima, Arjuna and Draupadi Rathas. 
                        The latter two share a common platform.
                        There is a lion west of the Arjuna-Draupadi platform, a seated bull on its east and a standing elephant on its southwest. 
                        The Nakula and Sahadeva Ratha is northwest of Bhima Ratha and southwest of Arjuna Ratha, behind the elephant. 
                        The cross-sectional axis of the Nakula and Sahadeva Ratha is in the centre of the group.
                        All the temples have a west entrance except the Nakula-Sahadeva Ratha, which has a south entrance.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        <b>Cave Temples</b><br>
                        Mandapa is a Sanskrit term for a typically square vestibule, pillared hall or pavilion.
                        It was a space for people to gather socially, usually for ceremonies and rite-of-passage rituals. 
                        Cells or sanctums would often be included, creating a vihara. 
                        Mandapas also refer to rock-cut cave temples or shrines, built according to the same concept, and Mamallapuram has many mandapas dated to the 7th and 8th centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Rock Reliefs</b><br>
                        Reliefs are carved on rocks or boulders. 
                        These include the wall of the Krishna mandapa, where a superstructure was added in front of the relief. 
                        The best-known rock relief in Mahablipuram is the Descent of the Ganges (also known as Arjuna's Penance or Bhagiratha's Penance), the largest open-air rock relief.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Structural Temples</b><br>
                        The structural (free-standing) temples at Mamallapuram have been built with cut stones as building blocks, rather than carved into a rock (cave temples) or out of a rock (ratha temples). 
                        Surviving examples, fewer in number and representing a different stage, style and sophistication than the other monuments, are some of best examples of early medieval Tamil Hindu-temple architecture. 
                        These temples (like other monuments in Mamallapuram) were dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Durga, although more Shiva iconography has survived.

                                                    <b>Ratha temples</b><br>
                                                    The ratha temples, in southern Mahabalipuram, are carved in the shape of chariots. 
                                                    Their artists used naturally-occurring blocks of diorite and granite in sand, carving legends in stone.
                                                    The best-known are the five monolithic structures projecting above the beach, known as the Five Rathas or the Pandava Rathas. 
                                                    In the Mahabharata, the Pandavas are five brothers with a common wife, Draupadi. 
                                                    Although the symbolism and grouping of the temples have led to these popular names, they are neither true rathas nor dedicated to the Pandavas; 
                                                    they are temples dedicated to deities and concepts of the Shaivi, (Shiva), Vaishnavi (Vishnu) and Shakti (Durga) traditions of Hinduism.<br>
                                                    The five-ratha group is on a north - south axis with the Dharmaraja Ratha at the south end, followed by the Bhima, Arjuna and Draupadi Rathas. 
                                                    The latter two share a common platform.
                                                    There is a lion west of the Arjuna-Draupadi platform, a seated bull on its east and a standing elephant on its southwest. 
                                                    The Nakula and Sahadeva Ratha is northwest of Bhima Ratha and southwest of Arjuna Ratha, behind the elephant. 
                                                    The cross-sectional axis of the Nakula and Sahadeva Ratha is in the centre of the group.
                                                    All the temples have a west entrance except the Nakula-Sahadeva Ratha, which has a south entrance.

                                                    <b>Cave Temples</b><br>
                                                    Mandapa is a Sanskrit term for a typically square vestibule, pillared hall or pavilion.
                                                    It was a space for people to gather socially, usually for ceremonies and rite-of-passage rituals. 
                                                    Cells or sanctums would often be included, creating a vihara. 
                                                    Mandapas also refer to rock-cut cave temples or shrines, built according to the same concept, and Mamallapuram has many mandapas dated to the 7th and 8th centuries.

                                                    <b>Rock Reliefs</b><br>
                                                    Reliefs are carved on rocks or boulders. 
                                                    These include the wall of the Krishna mandapa, where a superstructure was added in front of the relief. 
                                                    The best-known rock relief in Mahablipuram is the Descent of the Ganges (also known as Arjuna's Penance or Bhagiratha's Penance), the largest open-air rock relief.
                                                </p>

                                                    <b>Structural Temples</b><br>
                                                    The structural (free-standing) temples at Mamallapuram have been built with cut stones as building blocks, rather than carved into a rock (cave temples) or out of a rock (ratha temples). 
                                                    Surviving examples, fewer in number and representing a different stage, style and sophistication than the other monuments, are some of best examples of early medieval Tamil Hindu-temple architecture. 
                                                    These temples (like other monuments in Mamallapuram) were dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Durga, although more Shiva iconography has survived.
                                                </p>`
