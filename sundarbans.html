                        It contains the world's largest area of mangrove forests. A number of rare or endangered species live in the park, including tigers, aquatic mammals, birds and reptiles.

                        The Sundarbans National Park is a national park, tiger reserve and biosphere reserve in West Bengal, India. 
                        It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges Delta and adjacent to the Sundarban Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. 
                        It is located to south-west of the Bangladesh. 
                        The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. 
                        It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. 
                        The present Sundarban National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarban Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. 
                        On 4 May 1984 it was declared a national park. 
                        It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed in 1987, and it has been designated as a Ramsar site since 2019.
                        It is considered as a World Network of Biosphere Reserve (Man and Biosphere Reserve) from 1989.

                    <p>
                        The Sundarban National Park is located between 21° 432' - 21° 55' N latitude and between 88° 42' - 89° 04' E longitude. 
                        The average altitude of the park is 7.5 m above sea level. 
                        The park is composed of 54 small islands and intersected by several distributaries of the Ganges river.

                    <p>
                        The coastal active delta of Sundarban at the mouth of Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh, having a complex geomorphologic and hydrological character with climatic hazards, has a vast area of mangrove forests with a variety of flora and diverse fauna in a unique ecosystem. 
                        The natural environment and coastal ecosystem of this Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site is under threat of physical disaster due to unscientific and excessive human interferences. 
                        Conservation and environmental management plan for safeguarding this unique coastal ecology and ecosystem is urgently required.

                        Sundarban has achieved its name from the Sundari tree. 
                        The word, "Sundari", comes from the Sanskrit word "Sundara". 
                        It is the most exquisite variety of tree that are found in this area, a special kind of mangrove tree. 
                        It has specialised roots called pneumatophores which emerge above ground and help in gaseous exchange i.e. respiration. 
                        During the rainy season when the entire forest is waterlogged, the spikes rising from the ground has their peak in the air and helps in the respiration process.
