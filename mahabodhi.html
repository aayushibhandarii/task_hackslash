                        The Mahabodhi Temple Complex is one of the four holy sites related to the life of the Lord Buddha, and particularly to the attainment of Enlightenment. 
                        The first temple was built by Emperor Asoka in the 3rd century B.C., and the present temple dates from the 5th or 6th centuries. 
                        It is one of the earliest Buddhist temples built entirely in brick, still standing in India, from the late Gupta period.

                        Traditional accounts say that, around 589 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama, a young prince who saw the suffering of the world and wanted to end it, reached the forested banks of the Phalgu river, near the city of Gaya, India. 
                        There he sat in meditation under a peepul tree (Ficus religiosa or Sacred Fig) which later became known as the Bodhi tree. 
                        According to Buddhist scriptures, after three days and three nights, Siddharta attained enlightenment and the answers that he had sought. 
                        In that location, Mahabodhi Temple was built by Emperor Ashoka in around 260 BCE.

                        <b>Mahabodhi Tree</b><br>
                        The Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya is directly connected to the life of the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, who attained enlightenment or omniscient wisdom when he was meditating under it. 
                        The temple was built directly to the east of the Bodhi tree, supposedly a direct descendant of the original Bodhi Tree.<br>
                        According to Buddhist mythology, if no Bodhi tree grows at the site, the ground around the Bodhi tree is devoid of all plants for a distance of one royal karīsa. 
                        Through the ground around the Bodhi tree no being, not even an elephant, can travel.<br>

                        Mahabodhi Temple is constructed of brick and is one of the oldest brick structures to have survived in eastern India. 
                        It is considered to be a fine example of Indian brickwork, and was highly influential in the development of later architectural traditions. 
                        According to UNESCO, "the present temple is one of the earliest and most imposing structures built entirely in brick from Gupta period" (300 - 600 CE).
                         Mahabodhi Temple's central tower rises 55 metres (180 ft), and were heavily renovated in the 19th century. 
                         The central tower is surrounded by four smaller towers, constructed in the same style.<br>
                         The Mahabodhi Temple is surrounded on all four sides by stone railings, about two metres high. 
                         The railings reveal two distinct types, both in style as well as the materials used. 
                         The older ones, made of sandstone, date to about 150 BCE, and the others, constructed from unpolished coarse granite, are believed to be of the Gupta period.
