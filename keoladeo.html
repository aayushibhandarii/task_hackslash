                        This former duck-hunting reserve of the Maharajas is one of the major wintering areas for large numbers of aquatic birds from Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, China and Siberia. 
                        Some 364 species of birds, including the rare Siberian crane, have been recorded in the park.

                        The sanctuary was created 250 years ago and is named after a Keoladeo (Shiva) temple within its boundaries. 
                        Initially, it was a natural depression; and was flooded after the Ajan Bund was constructed by Maharaja Suraj Mal, then the ruler of the princely state of Bharatpur, between 1726 and 1763. 
                        The bund was created at the confluence of two rivers, the Gambhir and Banganga. 
                        The park was a hunting ground for the Maharajas of Bharatpur, a tradition dating back to 1850, and duck shoots were organised yearly in honour of the British viceroys. 
                        In one shoot alone in 1938, over 4,273 birds such as mallards and teals were killed by Lord Linlithgow, then Viceroy of India.<br>
                        This park was established as a national park on 10 March 1982. 
                        Previously the private duck shooting preserve of the Maharaja of Bharatpur since the 1850s, the area was designated as a bird sanctuary on 13 March 1976 and a Ramsar site under the Ramsar Convention in October 1981.<br>
                        Keoladeo Ghana National Park was made a World Heritage Site in 1985.

                        Keoladeo National Park is 2 km (1.2 mi) south-east of Bharatpur and 55 km (34 mi) west of Agra. 
                        It is spread over approx 29 km2 (11 sq mi). 
                        One third of the Keoladeo National Park is wetland with mounds, dykes, and open water with or without submerged or emergent plants. 
                        The uplands have grasslands with tall grass species together with scattered trees and shrubs present in varying density.
                        A similar habitat with short grasses, such as Cynodon dactylon and Dichanthium annulatum also exists. 
                        Woodlands with thickets of huge Kadam trees (Neolamarckia cadamba) are distributed in scattered pockets. 
                        The park's flora consists of 379 species of flowering plants of which 96 are wetland species. 
                        The wetland is a part of the Indo-Gangetic Great Plains.

                        Macro invertebrates such as worms, insects, and mollusks, though more abundant in variety and numbers than any other group of organisms, are present mostly in aquatic habitats. 
                        They are food for many fish and birds, as well as some animal species, and hence, constitute a major link in the food chain and functioning of the ecosystem. 
                        Land insects are in abundance and have a positive effect on the breeding of land birds.<br>
                        Keoladeo National Park is known as a "bird paradise", since more than 370 bird species have been recorded in the park.<br>
                        Mammalian fauna of Keoladeo National Park is equally rich with 27 identified species.<br>
                        Fish fauna of the park comprises 43 species, of which 37 enter the park along with the water from Ajan Bund, and six species are breeding residents. 
                        During a good rainy season the park receives around 65 million fish fry and fingerlings.
